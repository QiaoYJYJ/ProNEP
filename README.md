Identifying nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor and pathogen effector pairing using transfer-learning and bilinear attention network 
ProNEP is an computational method designed for the precise identification of Correspondence between NLRs (Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors) and effectors.  Leveraging the power of transfer learning and a sophisticated bilinear attention network, ProNEP is implemented within the PyTorch framework, utilizing protein sequences as input.
